# NYCPS AI Fellowship Application - Statement of Intent
Jonathan Swotinsky

My interest in this fellowship stems from the exciting opportunities that AI represents for all students. By providing students the opportunities to learn about AI, we are preparing them to become thoughtful, ethical, and safe users of technology, thereby empowering them to positively impact themselves, their families, and their communities. As a Computer Science teacher, I am equally excited about the emerging career pathways this skill set will open up for all students including those interested in applying it directly to careers in technology as well as those who are passionate about pursuing a career outside of the technology sector.<br>

In thinking about this work, I recognize that I don’t have all, or even close to most, of the answers.  By participating in this fellowship, I hope to improve my own understanding of AI and how it can be leveraged to support students, while also collaborating with others to develop strategies, best practices, and resources to support all educators in serving all students.  In thinking about my own school community, the following problem of practice comes to mind:<br>

> “How can we leverage AI to provide students access to deeper level thinking and learning rather than having AI do the thinking and learning for them?”

Through this fellowship, I hope to implement what I learn with my own students as well as to share the resources we develop with other educators not only in my own school community, but also in my professional network.
